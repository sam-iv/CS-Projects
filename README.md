### [Films4You Database Analyser](Films4You-Database-Analyser)

This project involves building an application to complement a company's existing database system. The system will provide analytics based on the database, motivated by the requirements of its potential stakeholders in the given scenario.

Scenario:

"You are working for a client, Films4You, a movie rental company, which lends movies to customers. It has a number of staff and physical stores. Films4You wants to build a system that models and interfaces with its existing database. This system should be able to analyse Films4You's database so the company can make informed business decisions to remain competitive. The existing database is used primarily by Films4You's staff, but this could change."
